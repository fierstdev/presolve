Repository state

* Branch: main
* Latest commit: compiler: evaluate static list members
* Working tree: clean after committing this slice
* Date: 2026-07-10 18:30:58 PDT

Last completed slice

* Slice: 7F-F - Member-expression evaluation
* Summary: Added constrained static evaluation for dot-member expressions over serializable object list items.
* Key files: crates/ezc_core/src/component_graph.rs, crates/ezc_core/src/html_codegen.rs, crates/ezc_core/src/lib.rs, crates/ezc_cli/tests/explain.rs
* New behavior: Static list templates resolve expressions such as `item.label` and `item.details.region`; member keys such as `item.id` produce stable initial item IDs. Missing or non-primitive initial key members produce `EZC1015`.
* Tests added or changed: core static HTML coverage for nested member bindings and member-derived IDs, CLI HTML/manifest goldens, and expanded key diagnostics coverage for missing members.
* Fixtures added or changed: fixtures/0024-static-object-keyed-list; updated 0019 and 0022 keyed-list graph fixtures

Current in-progress slice

* Slice: 7F - Lists and keys
* Status: In progress
* Completed: 7F-A - List semantic model; 7F-B - Static initial list rendering; 7F-C - Keyed reconciliation; 7F-D - Key diagnostics; 7F-E - Recursive object serializable values; 7F-F - Member-expression evaluation
* Remaining: 7F-G - Object keyed-list reconciliation; 7F-H - Dynamic list-item behavior.

Architecture decisions made

* Decision: Conditional nodes are first-class parser/render/template children with a conditional node ID plus separate start/end boundary IDs.
* Reason: The compiler needs stable branch identity for tooling and runtime updates, while the DOM needs comment anchors that can bound branch replacement without a wrapper element.
* Tradeoff: Runtime manifests serialize branch HTML snippets for this first slice instead of recursively hydrating dynamic bindings/events inside branch snippets.
* Decision: Logical-and shorthand reuses the same conditional model with an empty false branch.
* Reason: It keeps ternary and shorthand update behavior identical once the branch anchor path is stable.
* Decision: Keyed list nodes are represented before arrays, static list HTML, manifest serialization, or runtime reconciliation.
* Reason: The compiler needs a stable semantic contract for list identity before committing to array values or DOM update behavior.
* Tradeoff: List item templates are visible in parser/component/template tooling, but they intentionally emit no initial DOM content or runtime manifest records yet.
* Decision: Serializable arrays may contain serializable primitives or nested arrays, but static list item binding resolution is limited to the exact item variable and optional index variable.
* Reason: It enables initial list rendering without introducing object-value semantics or arbitrary expression evaluation.
* Tradeoff: Object entries and member expressions such as `item.id` remain semantic metadata only; their initial values are not rendered in 7F-B.
* Decision: A list manifest owns a start/end anchor pair, the iterable state dependency, item/key variables, an item-root template ID, and placeholder HTML for a new root.
* Reason: The runtime can build a key-to-element index from static HTML and reconcile roots without an application-specific virtual DOM.
* Tradeoff: Runtime reconciliation is intentionally constrained to one root element per item and local item/index text substitution; nested dynamic behavior inside list items is not hydrated yet.
* Decision: Until member-expression evaluation is implemented, a keyed list must use its direct item variable as the key.
* Reason: The compiler and runtime can prove direct primitive key identity, report unstable forms before emitting artifacts, and defer object/member access semantics to the dedicated evaluation slice.
* Tradeoff: Existing member-expression keys such as `item.id` now produce `EZC1013` instead of silently falling back to index identity.
* Decision: Serializable object values use ordered maps with static identifier, string, or numeric keys.
* Reason: The compiler needs recursively traversable data that serializes to deterministic JSON objects in manifests without introducing a new dependency or arbitrary expression evaluation.
* Tradeoff: Spreads, computed keys, shorthand references, methods, accessors, and non-literal property values remain unsupported until later language slices define their semantics.
* Decision: Static list member evaluation accepts non-empty dot paths rooted at the list item variable.
* Reason: A small, compiler-owned evaluator can resolve object members for static HTML, member-derived IDs, and diagnostics without becoming a general JavaScript interpreter.
* Tradeoff: Member expressions are evaluated only from compile-time initial list items. Runtime template substitution and reconciliation remain deferred to 7F-G.

Known limitations

* Item: Conditional rendering only supports simple `this.<stateField>` conditions with JSX element or fragment branches.
* Item: Conditional branch snippets are replaced as static HTML. Bindings, events, and nested dynamic behavior inside swapped-in branch snippets are not re-registered yet.
* Item: Keyed lists currently accept only `iterable.map((item, index?) => <element>...</element>)` with identifier parameters and an expression-bodied callback. Static lists support a direct primitive item key or a dot-member key such as `item.id` that resolves to a unique primitive.
* Item: Missing keys, index keys, unsupported expressions, duplicate statically-known primitive keys, and missing/non-primitive member keys emit `EZC1011` through `EZC1015`.
* Item: List item templates must have one root element. Static HTML resolves direct item/index values and dot-member bindings, but new runtime instances still substitute only direct item/index text bindings until 7F-G.
* Item: Duplicate runtime list keys that arise from dynamic state still produce `EZR_DUPLICATE_LIST_KEY` and the later duplicate is skipped. The compiler detects only duplicate statically-known primitive initial values.
* Item: Only `this.<field>++`, `this.<field>--`, `this.<field> += <literal>`, `this.<field> -= <literal>`, `this.<field> = <literal>`, and `this.<field> = !this.<field>` are recognized as action steps.
* Item: The browser runtime supports only delegated click events, ordered closed action steps, numeric/string/boolean/null initial state, binding callback text/attribute updates, and conditional branch replacement.
* Item: Static and `this.<stateField>` dynamic JSX attributes are preserved, but `className`/`htmlFor` normalization policy is still intentionally undecided.
* Item: Dynamic attributes are limited to primitive state-field bindings; arbitrary expressions, method calls, spread attributes, arrays, and objects are not emitted yet.
* Item: The serializable value model supports primitives, recursive arrays, and recursive object literals. Static member paths resolve object data, but runtime member evaluation and object keyed reconciliation remain deferred to 7F-G.
* Item: Runtime schema compatibility is exact-match only; no backward/forward manifest migration exists yet.
* Item: Source spans are available on parser/render/template structures and CLI development output, but runtime manifests intentionally omit source metadata for now.
* Item: Fragment nodes are visible in compiler/template output but intentionally omitted from runtime manifests until a runtime range-anchor use case appears.
* Item: Browser e2e requires a local Chrome binary or `EDGEZERO_CHROME=/path/to/chrome`.
* Item: GitHub Actions Chrome e2e repair is locally validated with `CI=true` but not yet confirmed by a new hosted run.

Exact next step

Start Slice 7F-G - Object keyed-list reconciliation. Teach the browser runtime to evaluate member-derived keys and substitute member bindings for inserted object list items, then verify retained identity across object list reorder, insertion, and deletion.
