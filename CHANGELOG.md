# Changelog

This repository follows Keep a Changelog-style entries. Changes are recorded
under `Unreleased` and grouped by Added, Changed, Fixed, Deprecated, Removed,
and Security as applicable. A release entry names the released version and
date only after the corresponding artifacts have been verified; this file does
not publish or imply a release.

## Unreleased

### Changed

- Advanced the complete compiler, framework, tooling, and extension release
  train to `0.1.0-alpha.2` after the incomplete alpha.1 publication.

### Fixed

- Native CLI packaging now resolves package directories as validated local
  paths instead of npm GitHub package specifications.

### Added

- Public `presolve`, `@presolve/cli`, and `create-presolve` release surfaces.
- A TypeScript 7 starter project and installable `presolve-vscode` extension

  staging.
- Public alpha documentation for framework authoring, metaframework workflow,

  identify `0.1.0-alpha.1`.
